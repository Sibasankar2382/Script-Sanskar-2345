This project centers around the prediction of stock prices for NIFTY-50 stocks, employing a robust model trained on a comprehensive dataset spanning four years of historical data. Users have the flexibility to input their stock preferences, specify quantities, and designate buying and selling dates, enabling thorough portfolio analysis. Whether forecasting future prices or leveraging historical data, the model efficiently computes the portfolio's returns. Furthermore, seamless integration with Google Sheets enhances user convenience, offering a potent tool for investors to make well-informed decisions and conduct insightful analyses of their investments.
